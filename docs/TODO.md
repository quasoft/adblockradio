## Must have
* [ ] Menu to open folder with recordings
* [ ] GUI editor for management of radio stations
* [ ] Make QT4 dependency optional, as player should run without GUI, if started with `--console` option
* [ ] Create tests
* [X] Create Ubuntu install package (`.deb`)

## Nice to have
* [ ] Add `--record-training-data` option for automatic recording of both songs and advertisements. This would allow machine learning to be used for automatic detection of ads at a later stage
* [ ] Detect advertisements with machine learning classification
* [ ] Test under Windows and create Windows installer
